An Open Technical Note to Eric Schmidt (TED 2025)

Regarding: “The AI Revolution Is Underhyped” – TED Talk, 2025

Dr. Schmidt,

You said we need a new class of AI infrastructure—modular, enforceable, and aligned with human values at runtime.
I couldn’t agree more.

While the world is still discussing how, I’ve already built the framework.
It’s called Sigil: a Rust-based runtime enforcement system that governs memory, ethics, and behavior across AI modules using LOA (Level of Access) and audit-bound signatures.

Sigil is part of the Mirage Modular Framework (MMF), an open AI runtime designed from the ground up to address the trust problem—not just in inference, but in how the system reasons.
Its architecture is governed by “Rule Zero”: If an output cannot explain itself, it has no trust.

This isn’t a pitch. It’s a signal.

If you want to see the blueprint, I’ll show it.
If not, no harm. Sigil’s already moving.

# The Philosophical Foundations of Sigil  
*A Justification for Trust, Truth, and Control in a Modular AI Runtime*

Sigil is more than infrastructure. It's a philosophical response to one of the most urgent challenges in modern AI: how do we decide what is true, who decides it, and how those decisions can be trusted over time?

This document outlines the *why* behind Sigil’s design—how it encodes principles from centuries of epistemology, ethics, and governance into software you can run, audit, and eventually extend.

## 1. Epistemic Hygiene — How Sigil Defines "Truth"

"If it cannot be validated, it cannot be Canon."

Sigil treats truth as a provenance-bound structure. Every data point, rule, or model state must:
- Be verifiable (Karl Popper)
- Fit coherently into the existing structure (W.V.O. Quine)
- Change only under supervised paradigm shifts (Thomas Kuhn)

Canonical data is not editable on a whim. Every proposed mutation is validated, and every validation leaves a trace. You cannot overwrite the past—only build upon it with quorum.

**Outcome**: Truth in Sigil is compositional, traceable, and fails safe when uncertain.

## 2. Governance — Who Has the Right to Decide?

"Power is not given. It is leased, explicitly."

Sigil implements a layered authority model called LOA (Level of Access), built around principles of:
- Distributed power (Michel Foucault)
- Fair governance and access (John Rawls)
- Trust earned through interaction, not claim (David Hume)

Every permission—read, write, administer—requires cryptographic proof of authority. These aren’t hidden in config files; they’re part of the protocol. Even the system’s root identity must follow the same rules.

**Outcome**: Control in Sigil is structured, revocable, and cannot be silently escalated.

## 3. Ethical Enforcement — How Sigil Handles Right vs. Wrong

"No AI should act without knowing why."

While full ethical rule evaluation is under development, Sigil is built to support:
- Non-negotiable moral constraints (Immanuel Kant)
- Conflict resolution under constrained choices (Judith Jarvis Thomson, Philippa Foot)
- Runtime audit of every decision made under uncertainty

This is not abstract. Sigil will be able to reject actions based on encoded values—like refusing a model update that introduces systemic bias, or pausing an action if its harm calculus cannot be resolved with certainty.

**Outcome**: Sigil is not a moral oracle—but it is a moral enforcer, by design.

## 4. Semantic Mutation — When Language Becomes Law

"You can't mutate what you can't understand."

Sigil’s next major evolution focuses on semantic contradiction detection and linguistic integrity—inspired by:
- Russell’s Paradox (preventing self-referential failure)
- Wittgenstein’s language games (meaning arises from context)
- Tarski’s semantic theory of truth (layered meta-truth)

This future module will evaluate Canon not just as syntax, but as meaning-bearing structure. Mutations will be rejected not only when they’re invalid—but when they would break meaning.

**Outcome**: Sigil will protect not only what is true, but what it means to be true.

## The Bottom Line

Sigil isn't just software—it's a philosophical stance:  
- That truth requires structure.  
- That authority must be earned.  
- That actions must be accountable.  
- And that meaning is part of the system, not just its output.

When you run Sigil, you're not just executing a program. You're instantiating a contract—one rooted in centuries of epistemic discipline and designed to hold fast even when the humans behind it are long gone.
