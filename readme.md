An Open Technical Note to Eric Schmidt (TED 2025)

Regarding: “The AI Revolution Is Underhyped” – TED Talk, 2025

Dr. Schmidt,

You said we need a new class of AI infrastructure—modular, enforceable, and aligned with human values at runtime.
I couldn’t agree more.

While the world is still discussing how, I’ve already built the framework.
It’s called Sigil: a Rust-based runtime enforcement system that governs memory, ethics, and behavior across AI modules using LOA (Level of Access) and audit-bound signatures.

Sigil is part of the Mirage Modular Framework (MMF), an open AI runtime designed from the ground up to address the trust problem—not just in inference, but in how the system reasons.
Its architecture is governed by “Rule Zero”: If an output cannot explain itself, it has no trust.

This isn’t a pitch. It’s a signal.

If you want to see the blueprint, I’ll show it.
If not, no harm. Sigil’s already moving.
